/**
 * Calendar-date helpers, shared because the write and read paths must agree.

 * Every date-only column (`Attendance.date`, `Student.startDate`/`endDate`) is
 * stored as **UTC midnight of the intended calendar day**, so a date-only
 * comparison is a straight timestamp comparison between two values produced
 * here. Mixing in a raw `new Date()` breaks that: the server may run in UTC
 * while the school is in Asia/Manila (UTC+8), and the UTC day only rolls over
 * at 08:00 Manila.
 *
 * `submitAttendance` used to be the only caller that got this right; the
 * coordinator's dashboard and oversight read the *server's* UTC day, so
 * between 00:00 and 07:59 Manila they disagreed with the write path by a day
 * and "Present Today" read 0 while students had already logged.
